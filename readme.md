# Tetris Diagram Editor
This is a slightly modified copy of the tetris diagram editor found at https://fumen.zui.jp/.  
I am not the original author but I made this copy so I could use it locally and add some quality of life features to it.

Modifications:
- Configurable hotkeys 
- Setting to control number of rows in list view
- Show list view under editor. Clicking on a frame in the list jumps to that frame in the editor.
- includes `greyout.js`, `mirror.js` add-ons made by swng.
- Auto Color add-on which automatically colors your blocks when it detects you have drawn a tetromino shape.
- `english.js`, `greyout.js`, `mirror.js`, `frame.js`, `listing.js`, `autoColor.js` and `pfcode.js` add-ons are loaded automatically.
- if Auto Output is checked, it will also auto update the pfcode diagram.
- added button for copying pfcode diagram to clipboard.
- fumen urls support starting with `#?` as in `http://harddrop.com/fumen/#?v115@vhAAgH`. This allows for sharing much longer fumen urls because these urls are character limited by the web browser instead of the server.

If you somehow found this not knowing what it is and you need a guide for how to use the fumen diagram editor, see https://harddrop.com/forums/index.php?topic=4469.0.  
The guide is missing an image, which you can find on the web archive here https://web.archive.org/web/20200605163950if_/https://harddrop.com/file/pic/gallery/4148.jpg.
